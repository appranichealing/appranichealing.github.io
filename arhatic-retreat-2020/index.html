      <div id="why">
        <h3>Why attend Arhatic Retreat?</h3>
        <h5 class="my-4">Reason 1</h5>
        <p>Nurture the most vital relationship in your life: Student to Teacher</p>
        <p>Every relation needs to be nurtured or it will eventually wither. The same goes for the utmost relationship
          in our lives - our bond with our beloved Sadgurudev.</p>
        <p>That this remains, above any other, our foremost connection, is evident: Have you not noticed that the way we
          relate to others improves as our bond to our Great Teacher grows? And in our life, how would we respond, as
          sons and daughters, as parents, friends or spouses, colleagues, when anger, sorrow, pride or laziness come to
          the surface, if it were not for Master's Teachings? What would our relationships look like without the wisdom
          of Forgiveness?</p>
        <p>And how would we know any better without our Beloved Teacher's blessings of accurate perception and correct
          expression?</p>
        <p>So, come together in Arhatic Yoga Retreat to better yourself, to strengthen your pledge to serve Humanity and
          to feed the relationship to our Spiritual Teacher, with Gratitude, with Respect and Love, for its this
          relationship that truly feeds all others.</p>
        <h5 class="my-4">Reason 2</h5>
        <p>Usually we focus on the momentous benefits that an Arhatic Retreat has on our personal spiritual development.
          However, during these times, when shifts in energy need to be created not only on a personal, but on a larger
          scale, it's important to emphasise how an event like this affects the entire country and the surrounding areas
          where it takes place. When a large group of aspirants and disciples gathers for meditation, with a heart and
          will to serve, huge amount of divine energy can be brought down and absorbed. In fact, it creates a vortex,
          similar to a large chakra! Imagine the amount of energy received when hundreds of Arhatic Yoga practitioners
          invoke and pray simultaneously!"</p>
        <p>Such opportunities are exactly what the Higher Beings and Teachers are LITERALLY WAITING for, to downpour
          tremendous amounts of energy, with the group absorbs and grounds into the area, affecting, healing the entire
          country and the people. So, being in the Retreat is an opportunity to anchor and materialise Divine Energies
          into our planet.</p>
        <p>For a country like India, which has a significant role to play in bringing the Golden Age back, the blessings
          during the retreat are just the "medicine the doctor ordered" for healing the Humanity.</p>
        <h5 class="my-4">Reason 3</h5>
        <p>Retreat and Let Go...</p>
        <p>Retreats are the optimal way to remove ourselves from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and to offer
          ourselves the gift of physical, emotional and mental rejuvenation.</p>
        <p>To Retreat, echoes the notion of surrender and letting go; in fact, in Greek, to retreat, literally means to
          give space. So the more you let go, the more space is created.</p>
        <p>We surrender the stress and frustrations, the worries and dilemmas. We remove ourselves from our loved ones
          too, from our comfort, our contentment, our ease. And so it is, that for just 3 days we leave both our sweet
          and sour of the outer world to take a deep dive into the inner world. We make space for Divine Light, Divine
          Love and Divine Power. We laugh and make new friends, gain insights into the previously unknown and savour the
          abundant sweetness of our beloved Sadgrudev.</p>
        <p>And then, we re-emerge into the outer world empowered, rejuvenated, ready to serve and to live better than we
          ever could.</p>
        <p>Make a choice to let go. Mark your calendar now for 3 unique days!</p>
        <h5 class="my-4">Reason 4</h5>
        <p>Retreats provide the portals for the true treasure... the pearls of wisdom of our Beloved Teacher. Sadguru's
          energy received in transmission deep into our souls and infused in our lives. These are facilitated by the
          senior disciples who are also the embodiment of the various qualities of the Teacher.</p>
        <p>We are also reminded the Teacher's vision and reaffirm our role in the Divine Plan.</p>
        <p>ONLY ARHATIC RETREAT CAN PROVIDE ONE SUCH OPPORTUNITY...</p>
        <h5 class="my-4">Reason 5</h5>
        <p>Between the teachings, the friendships (new and old), the common experiences and the deep purifications,
          whatever potentials are yearning inside us begin to surface and bloom.</p>
        <p>As our intuitive minds come alight, our vision and goals we have for the future become even more refined and
          defined.</p>
        <p>Arhatic Yoga Retreats ignite the flame of inspirations, provide an infinite reservoir of manifestation energy
          and sharpen our one-pointedness so that, we can pursue our Soul's purpose and Master's vision for Humanity
          with deeper certainty, more clarity and magnified power!
        </p>
        <p>Rediscover the inspiration in the midst of downpour of spiritual powers</p>
        <p>Join us for the Arhatic Retreat 2020.</p>
        <h5 class="my-4">Reason 6</h5>
        <p>Have you ever wondered how potent or important Arhatic Yoga Retreat really is?</p>
        <p>It is about the quality of the inner work taking place but also the quantity of energy.</p>
        <p>To quote Master's one of the closest disciples, "3 days at an Arhatic Yoga Retreat is equivalent to six
          months of Arhatic Yoga Practice. But this does not mean that we abstain or substitute daily practice before or
          after a Retreat. However it shows us how powerful 3 days can be."</p>
        <p>The deep purification that takes place during this time alone creates space for Divine energy to quench our
          physical, energetic, astral and mental bodies. As we begin each day a new, in a continuous process of
          relinquishing, receiving, sharing energy, so we end the day appeased, satiated with the beauty of the
          Teachings, blessed by the Great Teachers' presence, with the Love and Light brought down through the Masters
          and with the Divine communion shared with our fellow practitioners.</p>
        <p><strong>Arhatic Yoga Retreats are a gift to be experienced by as many as possible, as the many become
            one.</strong></p>
