      <div id="why">
        <h3>Why attend Arhatic Retreat?</h3>
        <h5 class="my-3">Reason 1</h5>
        <p>Nurture the most vital relationship in your life: Student to Teacher</p>
        <p>Every relation needs to be nurtured or it will eventually wither. The same goes for the utmost relationship in our lives - our bond with our beloved Sadgurudev.</p>
        <p>That this remains, above any other, our foremost connection, is evident: Have you not noticed that the way we relate to others improves as our bond to our Great Teacher grows? And in our life, how would we respond, as sons and daughters, as parents, friends or spouses, colleagues, when anger, sorrow, pride or laziness come to the surface, if it were not for Master's Teachings? What would our relationships look like without the wisdom of Forgiveness?</p>
        <p>And how would we know any better without our Beloved Teacher's blessings of accurate perception and correct expression?</p>
        <p>So, come together in Arhatic Yoga Retreat to better yourself, to strengthen your pledge to erve Humanity and to feed the relationship to our Spiritual Teacher, with Gratitude, with Respect and Love, for its this relationship that truly feeds all others.</p>
        <h5 class="my-3">Reason 2</h5>
        <p>Usually we focus on the momentous benefits that an Arhatic Retreat has on our personal spiritual development. However, during these times, when shifts in energy need to be created not only on a personal, but on a larger scale, it's important to emphasise how an event like this affects the entire country and the surrounding areas where it takes place. When a large group of aspirants and disciples gathers for meditation, with a heart and will to serve, huge amount of divine energy can be brought down and absorbed. In fact, it creates a vortex, similar to a large chakra! Imagine the amount of energy received when hundreds of Arhatic Yoga practitioners invoke and pray simultaneously!"</p>
        <p>Such opportunities are exactly what the Higher Beings and Teachers are LITERALLY WAITING for, to downpour tremendous amounts of energy, with the group absorbes and grounds into the area, affecting, healing the entire country and the people. So, being in the Retreat is an opprtunity to anchor and materialise Divine Energies into our planet.</p>
        <p>For a country like India, which has a significant role to play in bringing the Golden Age back, the blessings during the retrat are just the "medicine the doctor ordered" for healing the Humanity.</p>
        <h5 class="my-3">Reason 3</h5>
        <p>Retrat and Let Go...</p>
        <p>Retreats are the optimal way to remove ourselves from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and to offer ourselves the gift of physical, emotional and mental rejuvenation.</p>
        <p>To Retreat, echoes the notion of surrender and letting go; in fact, in Greek, to retreat, literally means to give space. So the more you let go, the more space is created.</p>
        <p>We surrender the stress and frustrations, the worries and dilemmas. We remove ourselves from our loved ones too, from our comfort, our contentment, our ease. And so it is, that for just 3 days we leave both our sweet and sour of the outer world to take a deep dive into the inner world. We make space for Divine Light, Divine Love and Divine Power. We laugh and make new friends,  gain insights into the previously unknown and savour the abundant sweetness of our beloved Sadgrudev.</p>
        <p>And then, we re-emerge into the outer world empowered, rejuvenated, ready to serve and to live better than we ever could.</p>
        <p>Make a choice to let go. Mark your calendar now for 3 unique days!</p>
